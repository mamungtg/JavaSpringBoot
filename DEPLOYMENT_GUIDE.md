# Deployment Guide: Using Ansible, Jenkins, Helm, Git & Kubernetes

This guide provides a high-level workflow for deploying a Java Spring Boot application with
Ansible automation, Helm charts, Jenkins pipelines, Git (with GitHub), and Kubernetes. Use
these instructions as a template and adapt them to your infrastructure and naming.

## 1. Source Control with Git/GitHub

1. Initialize a Git repository for your Spring Boot project.
2. Push the repository to GitHub for centralized version control.
3. Protect your `main` (or `master`) branch and enforce pull requests.

## 2. Continuous Integration with Jenkins

1. Create a Jenkins pipeline (declarative or scripted) in a `Jenkinsfile` stored in the repo.
2. The pipeline should:
   - Checkout code from GitHub.
   - Run unit tests and integration tests.
   - Build the application with Maven or Gradle.
   - Build a Docker image and push it to a registry (e.g., Docker Hub).
3. Configure webhooks in GitHub so that Jenkins builds on each pull request or commit.

## 3. Packaging with Helm

1. Create a Helm chart (`charts/<chart-name>`) describing your Kubernetes resources
   (Deployment, Service, Ingress, etc.).
2. Template out values like image tag, replica count, and environment variables.
3. Test the chart locally using `helm template` and `helm lint`.
4. Store the chart in the same Git repository or in a dedicated Helm chart repo.

## 4. Infrastructure Automation with Ansible

1. Write an Ansible playbook to install and configure Kubernetes clusters (if needed)
   or manage cluster resources.
2. Use Ansible tasks to:
   - Install required packages (kubectl, helm, Docker).
   - Authenticate with the container registry.
   - Deploy the Helm chart to your Kubernetes cluster using `helm upgrade --install`.
3. Parameterize the playbook with variables for environment (staging, production, etc.).

## 5. Kubernetes Deployment

1. Ensure your cluster (e.g., Minikube, AKS, EKS, GKE) is running and accessible.
2. Jenkins can trigger Ansible to deploy the new Docker image via Helm.
3. Monitor the rollout using `kubectl rollout status deployment/<name>`.
4. Expose your service using a LoadBalancer or Ingress and verify connectivity.

## 6. Putting It All Together

A typical flow is:
1. Developer pushes code to GitHub.
2. GitHub notifies Jenkins via webhook.
3. Jenkins builds, tests, and pushes a Docker image.
4. Jenkins triggers an Ansible playbook.
5. Ansible authenticates to the Kubernetes cluster and deploys the updated image via Helm.
6. The application is updated in Kubernetes with zero downtime (if configured).

This combination of tools enables a robust CI/CD pipeline with infrastructure-as-code
and reliable, repeatable deployments.
